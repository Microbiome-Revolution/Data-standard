| Site name     | Refers to field sampled. Name is based on the postcode of the site (or farm). Therefore, postcode SL5 7PY, 7PY is the last 3 characters of the farm postcode; 01. is the field number (In the event that there are multiple fields to be sampled. If there is only one field, label should remain 01.) And XX is sample e.g. 18. So 7PY.01.18 is the 18th sample in the first field from the farm with postcode SL5 7PY.     | Latin letters and Hindu-Arabic system digits E.g 7PY.01.18                     |  
| Gps latitude       | Geographical positioning system showing latitudinal points as obtained from Google maps.             | Hindu-Arabic system digits e.g. 51.409056,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
