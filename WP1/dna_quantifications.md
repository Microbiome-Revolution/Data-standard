| Plate      | The plate number used for the DNA quantification.                                     | Data takes the format "px" where x is the plate number. <br>E.g., plate 1 is labelled p1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  
| Well       | The well on a plate that a sample is assigned to on an alphanumeric grid.             | On a 96-well plate, the data is a combination of A-H and 1-12. <br> E.g., First row, fourth column of a plate is A4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sample     | The unique sample name assigned to the DNA quantification of a well.                  | The data can take multiple formats depending on its origin. Wells used for standardisation data are named "standardx", where x is a numeric designator. <br> <br>Samples named "EMPTY" have been intentionally left empty for baseline readings & cross-contamination validation for a specific plate. <br> <br> Samples beginning with "FK" originate from Farmer Kits, whereas other samples have been collected by staff using postcodes as a guide for naming. E.g. for Postcode SL5 7PY, 7PY is the last 3 characters of the farm postcode; 01. is the field number (In the event that there are multiple fields to be sampled. If there is only one field, label should remain 01.) And XX is sample e.g. 18. So 7PY.01.18 is the 18th sample in the first field from the farm with postcode SL5 7PY. <br> <br> Empty samples correspond to unused wells. | 
| Temp       | The temperature at which DNA quantification was conducted for a plate.                | Numeric values in Celsius                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
