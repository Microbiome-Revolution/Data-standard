| Column      | Description          | Data Description     |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Sample   | Sample identifier | Samples have to be linked to initial sample identifiers from WP1 |
| ASVs   | Amplicon Sequence Variant| Identified single, exact sequences that are statistically supported as being present in the sample |
| Curated_ASVs   | ASVs that passed additional filtering steps| ASVs further processed by LULU to give curated ASVs that are more reliable |
| OTUs   | Operational Taxonomic Units| Group of closely related individuals which are arranged together based on the similarity of specific sequences |
| Curated_OTUs   | OTUs that passed additional filtering steps| OTUs further processed by LULU to give curated OTUs that are more reliable |
| Taxonomy   | Taxonomic identification | Inferred taxonomic identification through sequence similarity searches |
| Confidence   | Confidence of each taxonomy assignment| Taxonomic assignments are accompanied by confidence scores that reflect sequence similarity to previously identified organisms in the used database |
